# ROBOISM-ATULAYA-SOLIDWORKS
In this task assigned by the ROBOISM club of IIT-ISM(DHANBAD) I have made a three wheeler bot in solid works.
Initially I have constructed a base for the bot and the one by one I have constructed the parts in bit by bit manner and assembled them one by one.
I am initially uploading the file in component manner and later on I will add the dimensions too.
For now the base is of 150*210 mm and ultrasonic sensors are of 45*20 with the circles of radius 8mm.
